## üíéDescription</br>
Has it ever happened that you were all set with the perfect dress for your big day but you forgot to take a rain check? 

Well, don‚Äôt worry. Our fashion recommender is here to save your day. This ain‚Äôt any regular fashion recommender but a recommender that will look out for you not only in terms of style but in terms of comfort. Now you may think how would one do that? We do this by providing you choices based on:

  - Weather of the day, to let you know if you should avoid certain apparel or carry some extra accessories
  - Season to illustrate different patterns
  - Occasion to keep you in check with the highest rated choices 

There is feature of favourites where you can add your favourite attires to the favourites collection and can remove attires from the favourites.
We suggest Shopping links from e-commerce websites for the selected attires by distinguishing prices.

And if this doesn‚Äôt seem enough, one can extend this in a thousand different ways, some of which are:

Integrating the health app with it to take an extra step and use the predicted menstrual cycle to enhance the outfit recommendation as to make it more comfortable.
Introducing a feedback mechanism to keep track of the user‚Äôs preferences in order to give better suggestions
Integrating the calendar app to take care of the important days and send a recommendation accordingly.

We have ‚ÄúA style for every story‚Äù so let it be known to the world :)
